ðŸ“¸ Nature & Poetry Photo Project - API Integration Documentation

Overview
This project combines photography with poetry to enhance the connection between nature and human emotions. By capturing photos of natural scenery, 
the camera automatically uses Google Cloud Vision to recognize the elements in the image and OpenAI API to generate a unique poem based on the detected content. 
The resulting combination of the photo and poem is printed instantly using a built-in printer.

Objectives
- Automatically identify natural elements in photos using Google Cloud Vision.
- Generate poetry inspired by the recognized content using OpenAI API.
- Print the final output (photo + poem) instantly to provide an engaging, physical keepsake.
